# Kasparro – Agentic FB Ads Performance Analyst

This repository contains my submission for the Applied AI Engineer assignment at Kasparro.  
The goal of this project is to design a small agent-based pipeline that analyses a Facebook Ads dataset, generates data-backed insights, evaluates them, and produces creative recommendations.

---

## 1. Project Overview

The solution follows a simple, modular structure using lightweight agents:

- **Planner** – breaks down the analysis task.
- **DataAgent** – loads the CSV dataset and computes key performance metrics.
- **InsightAgent** – generates structured insights based on the data.
- **Evaluator** – validates insights using simple quantitative checks.
- **CreativeGenerator** – produces basic creative ideas linked to each insight.

The final outputs are stored in the `reports/` directory.

pip install -r requirements.txt

python src/run.py


This will generate:

- `reports/insights.json`
- `reports/creatives.json`

---

## 4. Output Files

- **insights.json** – structured insights extracted from the dataset  
- **creatives.json** – simple creative ideas derived from insights  
- **report.md** – written summary of key findings and recommendations  

These represent the final deliverables for the assignment.

## 5. Notes

- The dataset used is the provided `synthetic_fb_ads_undergarments.csv`.
- The code is intentionally minimal and clear to highlight reasoning steps and agent modularity.
- No external AI or LLM services are used in this version to keep the pipeline deterministic and easy to run.
