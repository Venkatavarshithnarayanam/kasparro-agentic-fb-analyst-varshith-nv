## 2. Key Insights Identified

**1. CTR Performance Variation**  
There is a clear difference between the highest and lowest CTR ads. The top CTR performers consistently exceed 2.8%, while lower-performing ads fall below 0.2%. This suggests differences in creative appeal and audience relevance.

**2. Cost-per-Click Patterns**  
The average CPC is on the higher side, indicating that ads may not be optimally targeted or that the creatives require refinement. High CPC values reduce efficiency in driving conversions.

**3. Conversion Rate Insights**  
Only a small set of ads achieve notably high conversion rates. This suggests an opportunity to focus on creative elements and targeting combinations used in these high performers.

**4. CPM Levels**  
A higher-than-usual CPM may point towards increased competition or broader targeting. Optimisation through narrowing audience segments could help reduce costs.
